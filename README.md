# ğŸ’³ Credit Card Validator (Luhn Algorithm)

A simple C++ program that validates credit card numbers using the **Luhn algorithm** (Mod 10). This algorithm helps verify whether a credit/debit card number is **structurally valid** by checking its check digit.

## ğŸš€ Features
- Accepts credit card numbers as input
- Ignores spaces for flexibility
- Validates using the Luhn checksum method
- Detects common input errors
- CLI-based and beginner-friendly

## ğŸ“¦ How to Compile

```bash
g++ -o validator main.cpp
